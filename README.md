### 311 Calls:
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/311-data <br/>

## Abstract:
With our metrics, we found the best neighborhood to be Mount Oliver Borough, followed by Regent Square and East Carnegie. This was found by approximately equally weighing the amount of 311 calls, neighborhood arrests, and various factors from the fire incidents dataset. Those factors include the type of fires, the amount of alarms, and how many occurred. All three used some sort of scoring system to rank neighborhoods in each dataset. We combined those three scores to get the final list.
